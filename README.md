My Responsive Portfolio Project


1. Index page that refers to the home page of my website. Includes songs and a brief paragraph.

2. Portfolio page that includes my experience in the workforce, to provide insight into my personal background.

3. Contact page with email submission box and functional social media links. Email submission box will be fixed once I learn about PHP. Also contains my address, phone number, and email.

4. Footer with links to each page.

5. Navbar with page links. Presents a dropdown menu when the page resizes.

6. Used bootstrap as my main styling tool.

7. CSS file that tidies up the aesthetics. Adds the background for the body, shapes the pictures, etc.
