1. Index, which is my home page. Has a quick introduction and a quick example of what the viewer will see in the later pages.

2. Portfolio page that includes my experience in the workforce and school, to provide insight into my personal background. Also contains embedded songs of mine.

3. Contact page with email submission box and functional social media links. Email submission box will be fixed once I learn about PHP.

4. Footer with links to each page.

5. Navbar with page links in sidebar and my name.
