              Being highly driven in a creative sense, I focused more on alternative forms of education during my main highschool career. As a result, I ended up moving school to Richard Pfaff High School to finish my studies and earn my diploma.

              After graduating from highschool, I was determined to learn as much about myself as I could before continuing with my studies. During this time I did every odd job imaginable, ranging from door to door sales to supervising a toy store. <br> This time in my life was incredibly beneficial, and I believe I gained people skills that are highly adaptable and infinitely useful for what was to come when I started in the restaurant industry.

              After years of experimenting in the workforce, I found a career that I would be happy to stick with until I was finally ready to dedicate my life to an industry. <br> Starting as a dishwasher at Grounded Restaurant, I quickly moved up within a year to part time chef. From there I had the time of my life in a plethora of different restaurant environments, gaining culinary skills in both fine dining and uncommon types of fast food alike.

              As much as I loved the work and excelled within the industry, there came a time when I realized that I had a larger dream to strive for, and went back to school.

              I have always been an avid musician, starting with classical violin at age 6. After a year of violin I wanted to switch to guitar, so I found a teacher and played both classical and regular acoustic style music for roughly 12 years. <br> During this time I decided to start writing my own music, and still do to this day. There are some rough samples below, check them out if you want!
